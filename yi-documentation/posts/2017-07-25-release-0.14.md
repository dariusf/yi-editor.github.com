title: Release 0.14
author: Dmitry Ivanov

The 0.14 section in the CHANGELOG has only one entry:

```
 * yi-core now doesn't depend on dyre.
   Dynamic configuration support is now provided by yi-dynamic-configuration package.
```

(This is also a good moment to plug a [post about why you should have a CHANGELOG
file](http://tonsky.me/blog/blind-spot-in-dependency/))

See the [previous post](https://yi-editor.github.io/posts/2017-01-06-dyre/) on
what dyre is and how it's used in Yi.

The benefits of this change are:

 * Users of static configurations have a leaner editor.
 * Improved separation of concerns helps current developers to stay sane while
   helping potential developers to comprehend the codebase piece by piece

I intend to write another post about ongoing modularization of Yi and how it
went from one package to a dozen in the last five years and what's next in
this direction.

There are still areas where user experience is much worse than it should be (in
both static and dynamic configurations):

 * tweaking per-file indentation settings, like switching from spaces to tabs or different amount of spaces
 * tweaking GUI settings like colorscheme or (for pango frontend) font size
 * .. or in general when you're just changing some config values like numbers, strings and colors

If you feel any of it can be an interesting task, you're very welcome to join!
Here are some relevant tickets (but don't let these limit you):
